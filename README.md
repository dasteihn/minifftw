# Minimalistic MPI-FFTW

This is a minimalistic Pythonwrapper for the MPI-FFTW. As every human achievement,
it is created out of hate for existing solutions.

Minimalistic means, that this wrapper will not wrapp every functionality the
FFTW offers. Probably just the 1D transforms.

## WIP

This project is work in progress and not intended for productive use yet.
